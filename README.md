# 🏢 Simple Elevator Simulator

A simple elevator scheduling simulator that visualizes and compares different elevator dispatch algorithms in real-time. Built for educational purposes and algorithm analysis.

## 📋 Overview

This interactive web application simulates a multi-elevator system in a building with configurable floors and elevators. Users can test and compare different scheduling algorithms to understand their behavior, efficiency, and trade-offs in various scenarios.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Configurable Building**: Set 2-24 floors and 2-12 elevators
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch elevators move floor-by-floor with smooth animations
- **Multiple Operating Modes**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Manually assign calls to specific elevators
  - **Automatic Mode**: Algorithms automatically optimize elevator assignments

### Scheduling Algorithms

#### 1. **LOOK Algorithm** (Recommended)
- Elevators move in one direction, serving all requests in that direction
- Reverses direction only when no more requests exist ahead
- Optimal for overall system efficiency
- Similar to real-world elevator systems

#### 2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
- Always serves the nearest floor next, regardless of direction
- Minimizes immediate travel distance
- Fast response for nearby calls
- May cause starvation for distant floors

### User Interface
- **Building Visualization**: Visual representation of the building with floor numbers and call buttons
- **Queue Display**: View each elevator's upcoming stops in real-time
- **Control Panel**: Monitor elevator status, pending calls, and manual controls
- **Interactive Instructions**: Contextual help for each mode and algorithm

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phatpham9/simple-elevator-simulator.git
cd simple-elevator-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎮 How to Use

### Manual Mode
1. Click the up/down buttons next to any floor to request an elevator
2. Pending calls appear in the Control Panel
3. Click on an elevator button to manually assign the call
4. You can also send elevators directly to specific floors using the floor buttons

### Automatic Mode (LOOK)
1. Select "Auto - LOOK Algorithm" from the Scheduling Mode dropdown
2. Click call buttons - elevators are automatically assigned
3. Watch the queue display to see optimized stop sequences
4. Elevators maintain direction until no more requests ahead

### Automatic Mode (SSTF)
1. Select "Auto - SSTF Algorithm" from the Scheduling Mode dropdown
2. Elevators always move to the nearest floor next
3. Observe how it handles clustered vs. distributed calls
4. Notice potential starvation of distant floors with high traffic

## 🔧 Adding New Algorithms

The architecture is designed for easy algorithm extension:

1. **Create algorithm file** in `src/algorithms/`:
```javascript
// src/algorithms/newAlgorithm.js
export const newAlgorithm = (elevators, callFloor, callDirection) => {
    // Your algorithm logic
    return bestElevatorId
}

export const insertIntoQueueNew = (queue, currentFloor, direction, newFloor) => {
    // Your queue insertion logic
    return newQueue
}
```

2. **Register in scheduler** (`src/algorithms/elevatorScheduler.js`):
```javascript
import { newAlgorithm, insertIntoQueueNew } from './newAlgorithm'

export const getAlgorithm = (mode) => {
    switch (mode) {
        case 'new': return newAlgorithm
        // ...
    }
}
```

3. **Add to UI** (`src/components/ConfigurationPanel.jsx`):
```jsx
<option value="new">Auto - New Algorithm</option>
```

4. **Update instructions** in `InstructionsPanel.jsx`
