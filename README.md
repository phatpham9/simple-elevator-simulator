## 📋 Overview

This interactive web application simulates a multi-elevator system in a building with configurable floors and elevators. Users can test and compare different scheduling algorithms to understand their behavior, efficiency, and trade-offs in various scenarios. The simulator features realistic elevator mechanics including door animations, detailed operational states, and smooth floor-by-floor movement.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Configurable Building**: Set 2-24 floors and 2-12 elevators with real-time reconfiguration
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch elevators move floor-by-floor with smooth animations
- **Realistic Mechanics**: 
  - Door opening/closing animations with progress indicators
  - Detailed operational states (IDLE, MOVING, DOORS_OPENING, DOORS_OPEN, DOORS_CLOSING)
  - Configurable timing for travel and door operations
- **Multiple Operating Modes**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Manually assign calls to specific elevators with full control
  - **Automatic Mode**: Algorithms automatically optimize elevator assignments
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Collapsible sidebars for optimal screen space
  - Tabbed control panels for organized information
  - Real-time statistics dashboard
  - Call buttons on each floor (up/down directions)
  - Direct floor selection for elevators

### Scheduling Algorithms

#### 1. **LOOK Algorithm** (Recommended)
- Elevators move in one direction, serving all requests in that direction
- Reverses direction only when no more requests exist ahead
- Optimal for overall system efficiency
- Similar to real-world elevator systems

#### 2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
- Always serves the nearest floor next, regardless of direction
- Minimizes immediate travel distance
- Fast response for nearby calls
- May cause starvation for distant floors

### User Interface Components
- **Building Visualization**: 
  - Visual representation of the building with floor indicators
  - Interactive call buttons for each floor (up/down)
  - Animated elevator cars showing current position and state
  - Color-coded elevator indicators
- **Statistics Dashboard**: 
  - Active/idle elevator count
  - Pending calls tracking
  - Queue length monitoring
- **Right Sidebar**:
  - Algorithm and building configuration panel
  - Collapsible sections for better space management
  - Instructions panel with contextual help
- **Calls & Elevators Panel**:
  - Real-time queue display for each elevator
  - Elevator status monitoring (floor, direction, state)
  - Pending calls list with manual assignment controls
  - Direct elevator control buttons

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v10.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phatpham9/simple-elevator-simulator.git
cd simple-elevator-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

## 🎮 How to Use

### Manual Mode
1. Click the up/down buttons next to any floor to request an elevator
2. Pending calls appear in the Control Panel
3. Click on an elevator button to manually assign the call
4. You can also send elevators directly to specific floors using the floor buttons

### Automatic Mode (LOOK)
1. Select "Auto - LOOK Algorithm" from the Scheduling Mode dropdown
2. Click call buttons - elevators are automatically assigned
3. Watch the queue display to see optimized stop sequences
4. Elevators maintain direction until no more requests ahead

### Automatic Mode (SSTF)
1. Select "Auto - SSTF Algorithm" from the Scheduling Mode dropdown
2. Elevators always move to the nearest floor next
3. Observe how it handles clustered vs. distributed calls
4. Notice potential starvation of distant floors with high traffic

## 🔧 Adding New Algorithms

The architecture is designed for easy algorithm extension:

1. **Create algorithm file** in `src/algorithms/`:
```javascript
// src/algorithms/newAlgorithm.js

/**
 * Your algorithm description
 */
export const newAlgorithm = (elevators, callFloor, callDirection) => {
    // Implement your logic to select the best elevator
    // Return elevator ID or null
    return bestElevatorId
}

/**
 * Insert floor into queue based on your algorithm's logic
 */
export const insertIntoQueueNew = (queue, currentFloor, direction, newFloor) => {
    // Implement queue management logic
    return newQueue
}
```

2. **Register in scheduler** (`src/algorithms/elevatorScheduler.js`):
```javascript
import { newAlgorithm, insertIntoQueueNew } from './newAlgorithm'

export const getAlgorithm = (mode) => {
    switch (mode) {
        case 'new': return newAlgorithm
        // existing cases...
    }
}

export const insertIntoQueue = (mode) => {
    switch (mode) {
        case 'new': return insertIntoQueueNew
        // existing cases...
    }
}
```

3. **Add to UI** (`src/components/AlgorithmAndBuildingPanel.jsx`):
```jsx
<option value="new">Auto - New Algorithm</option>
```

4. **Update instructions** in `InstructionsPanel.jsx` with algorithm description and usage
